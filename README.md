# Loan-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
I developed a loan prediction system using Python and scikit-learn, achieving 68% accuracy on test data. By 
addressing challenges like imbalanced data and overfitting, I ensured reliable model performance. Deploying the 
system into production enabled real-time loan approval predictions, showcasing my ability to drive impactful 
solutions in data science and machine learning.
